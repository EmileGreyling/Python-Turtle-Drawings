# Simple Graphics With Python's Turtle Library
### Turtle is a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas. The onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the turtle and this is what gives the library its name. In short, the Python turtle library helps new programmers get a feel for what programming with Python is like in a fun and interactive way.

### Cool, right? This is just one of many different drawings you can make using the Python turtle library. Most developers use turtle to draw shapes, create designs, and make images. Others use turtle to create animations and even mini-games!
